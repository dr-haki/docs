Encapsulation is one of the four pillars   
of [[Object-Oriented Programming]] (OOP),   
often described as **Data Hiding** + **Bundling**.

In life we often need to learn how to.  
encapsulate our personal information.   
Not only in the online world,   
but also along people we know.   

> Privacy is power. 
> People cannot ruin what they don't know. 

The same happens in our application.   
The more secure and private our data,   
the more control we have.   

Classes expose **only** certain fields and methods   
to other classes for access.   
### How to encapsulate in Java OCA Exam 

1. Declare all instance variables (**data**) as **`private`**.
2. Provide **`public`** methods, commonly called **Getters** (access/read) and **Setters** (modify/write), to manage access to the private variables.

```java 
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter method for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter method for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter method for age
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}

```

> The "protected does not mean encapsulated" .
> It is easy to forget to fully privatize 
> the data in our application. 
> This might **violate strict encapsulation**. 

### Key Benefits

- **Data Integrity/Validation:** Setters allow you to enforce rules (e.g., age cannot be negative) before modifying the data.
- **Control:** You can make a variable read-only (provide a Getter but no Setter) or write-only.
- **Flexibility/Decoupling:** You can change the internal data structure or implementation (e.g., rename a private variable) without breaking any external code that relies only on the public methods.
