The **JVM** is an abstract   
computing machine.  
that enables a computer   
to run a Java program.   

It is the core component   
of the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**.  

It takes the platform-independent   
**bytecode** from the   
[[java compiler]]   
and translates it   
into the native machine code.  
of the specific hardware/OS it is running on.  

 The JVM is tailored for each operating system   
 (e.g., a Windows JVM, a Linux JVM).   
 This allows the _same_ bytecode to run   
 on any machine,   
 as long as that machine has the.  
 correct JVM implementation.  

> [!hint] JVM as an operating room
> Imagine the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is a universal, self-contained **operating room** 🏥 that exists inside any computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).

It uses tools such as   
the [[Garbage Collector]]  
for cleaning up objects that   
are no longer needed.   

In relation with  
[[Compiler VS Runtime Error]] ,  
the JVM may raise an exception   
while executing the code.   
Producing an unchecked   
exception such as `NullPointerException`.
